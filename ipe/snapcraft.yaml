summary: Ipe http://ipe.otfried.org/
description: Drawing editor for creating figures in PDF or PS formats
  Ipe supports making small figures for inclusion into LaTeX
  documents as well as making multi-page PDF presentations
  Ipe's main features are
    * Entry of text as LaTeX source code. This makes it easy to enter
      mathematical expressions, and to reuse the LaTeX-macros of the main
      document.  In the display text is displayed as it will appear in
      the figure.
    * Produces pure Postscript/PDF, including the text. Ipe converts the
      LaTeX-source to PDF or Postscript when the file is saved.
    * It is easy to align objects with respect to each other (for
      instance, to place a point on the intersection of two lines, or to
      draw a circle through three given points) using various snapping
      modes.
    * Users can provide ipelets (Ipe plug-ins) to add functionality to
      Ipe.  This way, Ipe can be extended for each task at hand.
    * The text model is based on Unicode, and has been tested with Korean,
      Chinese, and Japanese.
